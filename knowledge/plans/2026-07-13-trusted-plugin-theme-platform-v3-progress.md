# Trusted Plugin And Theme Platform V3 Progress Ledger

Date: 2026-07-13
Overall progress: **3%**
Active phase: **P1 - Trust Confirmation And Out-Of-Band Recovery (next)**

This ledger is the durable percentage and context-compaction checkpoint for the
V3 program. Update it before context compression, at every phase boundary, and
after any commit that materially changes the completion calculation.

## Percentage Model

Progress is weighted by implementation risk and verified phase exits. A phase
may contribute a fraction of its weight while work is in progress, but docs,
scaffolding, or demo-only code cannot satisfy a runtime exit criterion.

| Phase | Weight | Current completion | Earned |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| P0 Governance | 3% | 100% | 3% |
| P1 Trust/recovery | 6% | 0% | 0% |
| P2 Manifest/contracts | 7% | 0% | 0% |
| P3 Host API v2 | 8% | 0% | 0% |
| P4 Lifecycle/dependencies | 7% | 0% | 0% |
| P5 Database/commands | 8% | 0% | 0% |
| P6 Routes/middleware | 10% | 0% | 0% |
| P7 Workflow/admin/query/identity | 10% | 0% | 0% |
| P8 Theme compiler/runtime | 8% | 0% | 0% |
| P9 Components/assets/L2 | 8% | 0% | 0% |
| P10 Content/media/data | 8% | 0% | 0% |
| P11 Platform services | 6% | 0% | 0% |
| P12 Operations/ecosystem | 6% | 0% | 0% |
| P13 References/removal/final gates | 5% | 0% | 0% |

Displayed overall progress is the floor of earned weighted progress until the
program reaches 100% and every final gate passes.

## Completed P0 Evidence

- Read all required authority, module notes, and latest handoffs.
- Confirmed clean `main` baseline at `d72c9ac2c` before V3 edits.
- Generated the exact 27-theme + 72-plugin traceability matrix.
- Inventoried 204 API registrations and 113 Nuxt page/component surfaces with
  stable IDs and contract versions.
- Inventoried events, contribution points, provider slots, schedules, job kinds,
  cache, content/data, and 33 admin pages.
- Published the eleven-family Extension Surface Matrix for current core modules.
- Froze namespaces, migration flags, raw DB/custom guard policy, and rollback
  rules.
- Added reproducible v1 enable/theme-resolve/route-proxy/plugin-RPC benchmarks.
- Linked superseded historical decisions to the active V3 target.
- Passed catalog drift, focused Go tests/benchmarks, OpenAPI validation, Nuxt
  typecheck/build, and the full repository gate.
- Closed every P0 task and verification checkbox without changing production
  behavior.

## Compression Checkpoint Protocol

Before expected context compression:

1. Update this file's percentage, evidence, last commit, dirty files, and next
   command.
2. Update the active session handoff under `knowledge/sessions/`.
3. Run the focused tests for the current slice.
4. Inspect `git diff` and `git diff --cached`; stage only V3-owned hunks.
5. Commit every coherent buildable slice. If a slice cannot be committed,
   record the exact dirty files and why.
6. Resume from the recorded next command, not from conversation recollection.

## Last Durable Checkpoint

- Last pre-V3 commit: `d72c9ac2c`.
- Baseline localization prerequisite: `e25a79f4b`.
- P0 catalog freeze: `eedfcb2d6`.
- P0 performance/CI gate: `d21d7d90f`.
- Active-direction links: `3b98cfd88`.
- Dirty files: P0 completion/index/progress/handoff documentation only.
- Next command: commit the P0 completion record, then begin P1 by auditing the
  current enable/install trust path, CLI composition, bootstrap ordering, audit
  store, OpenAPI contracts, and admin impact UI.
